<h2>üìñ Scenario</h2>
<p>You are an up and coming YouTuber. You spent the last couple of years learning how to create more engaging content, in the process you've also spent a bit of money on the tools needed to create a quality product, i.e. lights, camera, microphone. Your YouTube channel only has 50 subscribers (which means that you can't monetise yet, which is fine because you're still building the channel), so when you release a video it averages around 100 views.</p>

<p>Your latest video however took a bit more time developing and you believe it's your best video yet, your views are up to 300, and you have a couple more subscribers in the process.</p>

<p>A week after your video was published, you find out that your video is being used by another channel. This channel has millions of subscribers so they've monetised their videos and have millions of views on that particular video (so they would be earning money off that video).</p>
