<h2>What is Risk Management?</h2>
<p>Risk management helps you make better business decisions. It involves reducing the things that could have a negative effect on your business. For example, reducing the risk of injury through safety procedures. You can also look for opportunities that could have a positive impact on your business.</p>

<h3>How You Can Manage Risk</h3>
<p>Begin by finding out about risk management practices and how you can use them. You should also talk to others involved in your business (including your employees and customers) to decide on the best way to manage risk in your business.</p>
<p>Before you decide what to do, you'll need to work out what your risks are and which ones are most urgent:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify</strong> ‚Äì work out what risks your business could face</li>
<li><strong>Analyse</strong> ‚Äì find the level of the risks and which ones are most urgent</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> ‚Äì compare the risk against set risk criteria to decide what to do</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why Manage Risk?</h3>
<p>By managing risk, you can reduce the impact of unexpected events on your business. Managing risk can also help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and the community</li>
<li>Improve staff confidence through <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/health-and-safety/work-health-and-safety" target="_blank">workplace health and safety (WHS)</a></li>
<li>Keep your business open during disasters with an <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/emergency-management/develop-an-emergency-management-plan" target="_blank">emergency management plan</a></li>
<li>Reduce compliance and insurance costs by having a lower risk of damages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks That You Must Manage</h3>
<p>You're required by law to manage some risks. For example, you must manage or reduce the risk of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidents and injury by making your workplace safe under <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/health-and-safety/work-health-and-safety" target="_blank">work health and safety (WHS) laws</a></li>
<li>Customer complaints by treating customers fairly under <a href="https://business.gov.au/products-and-services/fair-trading/australian-consumer-law" target="_blank">Australian Consumer Law</a></li>
<li>Injury or harm to employees by having <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/insurance/business-insurance#workers-compensation-insurance" target="_blank">workers' compensation insurance</a></li>
<li>Damaging the environment by meeting the <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/environmental-impact/manage-your-environmental-impact" target="_blank">environmental laws</a> that apply to you</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Risk</h3>
<p>It's a good idea to understand the different types of risks your business may face. Risks can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opportunity-based risk</strong> ‚Äì from choosing one option over other options (such as buying a new property)</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty-based risk</strong> ‚Äì from uncertain or unknown events (such as natural disasters or loss of suppliers)</li>
<li><strong>Hazard-based risk</strong> ‚Äì from dangerous materials or actions (such as using hazardous chemicals or working at heights)</li>
</ul>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Opportunity-Based Risks</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>This type of risk comes from taking one opportunity over others. By deciding to commit your resources to one opportunity, you risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing a better opportunity</li>
<li>Getting unexpected results</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunity-based risks for a business include moving to a different location, buying a new property, or selling a new product or service.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Uncertainty-Based Risks</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>This type of risk is from uncertainty around unknown or unexpected events. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damage by fire, flood or other natural disasters</li>
<li>Unexpected financial loss due to economic downturn</li>
<li>Loss of important suppliers or customers</li>
<li>Decrease in market share from new competitors</li>
<li>Court action</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the impact of uncertain events, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop an <a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/emergency-management/develop-an-emergency-management-plan" target="_blank">emergency management plan</a></li>
<li>Keep a supplier database to <a href="https://business.gov.au/products-and-services/inventory-management/manage-your-inventory" target="_blank">manage your stock</a></li>
<li>Seek and use regular feedback from customers</li>
<li>Check your business environment regularly for risks</li>
<li>Seek expert advice to check your business's financial health</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Hazard-Based Risks</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>These risks come from dangerous situations in the workplace. Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical hazards</strong> ‚Äì high noise levels, extreme weather</li>
<li><strong>Equipment hazards</strong> ‚Äì faulty equipment or poor processes</li>
<li><strong>Chemical hazards</strong> ‚Äì improper storage or use of dangerous chemicals</li>
<li><strong>Biological hazards</strong> ‚Äì viruses, bacteria, fungi or pests</li>
<li><strong>Ergonomic hazards</strong> ‚Äì poor workplace design or equipment use</li>
<li><strong>Psychological hazards</strong> ‚Äì <a href="https://business.gov.au/people/employees/equal-opportunity-and-diversity" target="_blank">bullying and harassment</a>, discrimination, heavy workload</li>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mitigating the Risk of Non-Compliance</h2>
<p>There are seven steps that can be followed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance:</p>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 1: Recognise the Risk</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>Risk vs Cost</h3>
<p>Legacy workplace compliance regimes have tended to deal with risk mitigation from a 'risk versus cost' perspective. This has resulted in much time and money being directed at work health and safety from a physical risk perspective.</p>

<h4>Is bullying, harassment and discrimination the NEW work health and safety?</h4>
<p>The Australian business environment has changed dramatically, whereby bullying, sexual harassment and discrimination are equally as important as physical safety. Industry surveys report that more than 70% of Australian businesses do not have a reliable workplace compliance system in place.</p>

<h4>Future leaders go beyond 'Risk vs Cost' towards 'Risk vs Reward'</h4>
<p>Future leaders are focusing on the rewards of having a workplace culture where people feel safe and treat each other fairly. They view workplace compliance as an 'investment' rather than a 'cost'.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 2: The Law Does Not Discriminate</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<p>The law does not discriminate based on size, type, or location of your business. Common myths include:</p>

<h4>Myth #1: We're just a small business</h4>
<p>Regardless of whether you have 5 or 5,000 employees, your business must meet its legal obligations when it comes to compliance training and workplace policies.</p>

<h4>Myth #2: We have an employee handbook</h4>
<p>The foundation for protecting your business is having both training AND policies in place, rolled out at induction and on an ongoing basis.</p>

<h4>Myth #3: Training is cost prohibitive</h4>
<p>The real cost comes from reputational damage and lack of engagement across your workforce when incidents occur.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 3: Training and Policies Are the Only Protection</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>What is Legal Liability?</h3>
<p>Legal liability (or vicarious liability) means you are held liable for workplace incidents. The question is whether you have taken 'all reasonable steps' to avoid such incidents.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the law, the starting point is whether your organisation has delivered suitable 'training' and whether you have appropriate 'policies and procedures' in place.</p>

<div class="feedback warning">
<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important:</strong> Having people sign off upon starting is not enough. You must demonstrate ongoing training and policy sign-off for the life of your employees.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 4: Respect the "Your Honour" Test</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>Begin with the End in Mind</h3>
<p>If an incident ended up in court, can you hand on heart say that you have taken all reasonable steps to ensure you have educated your people on workplace relations and safety matters?</p>

<p>The best organisations have considered the "Your Honour Test" and put a reliable workplace compliance system in place. Key questions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I train my staff?</li>
<li>Did I have policies in place?</li>
<li>Did my managers/supervisors follow the procedures outlined in the policies?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 5: Identify, Report, Resolve</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>Education is the Key</h3>
<p>The best organisations recognise that education around WHS, privacy, workplace bullying, sexual harassment, EEO, and appropriate use of internet and social media are all necessary.</p>

<p>Education is not just a one-off when somebody starts, but rather an ongoing commitment to deliver formal training, refresher training, and ongoing mentoring.</p>

<h4>Employee Handbooks Are Not Enough</h4>
<p>The best organisations address the education piece. They want their people to understand what appropriate behaviour looks like, identify inappropriate behaviour, and know how to report it. Only once something is reported can it be resolved.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 6: Foster a Good Workplace Culture</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>Management Requires Positive Role Models</h3>
<p>Like most things in life, it's a case of "show me don't tell me." What we see and hear is often what we follow.</p>

<p>The most highly engaged organisations have a careful and deliberate approach to human rights and appropriate workplace behaviours. Good managers and supervisors set the example, identify bad behaviour and deal with it, and reward good behaviour.</p>

<h4>We All Play a Role</h4>
<p>It's critical that an executive group and their managers/supervisors set the tone, but we all have a part to play when it comes to freeing our workplaces of incidents of bullying, sexual harassment and discrimination.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="accordion-item">
<div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">‚ñ∂ Step 7: Send a Clear Message from Top Down</div>
<div class="accordion-content">
<h3>Leadership Sets the Tone</h3>
<p>In the same way that a father treats a mother well, so too should a CEO treat their people well. In the same way that we make our children feel safe, so too should a CEO make their people feel safe. It starts from the top.</p>

<p>When an organisation truly invests in making their workplace better, safer and fairer, productivity sky rockets and the hidden costs of non-compliance diminish.</p>
