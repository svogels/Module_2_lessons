<h2>What is risk management?</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="body-copy-content" lang="en">
<p>Risk management helps you make better business decisions. It involves reducing the things that could have a negative effect on your business. For example, the reducing the risk of injury by through safety procedures. You can also look for opportunities that could have a positive impact on your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="body-copy-headline col-12">
<h2>How you can manage risk in your business</h2>
</div>
<hr>
<div class="body-copy-content" lang="en">
<p>Begin by finding out about risk management practices and how you can use them. You should also talk to others involved in your business (including your employees and customers) to decide on the best way to manage risk in your business.</p>
<p>Before you decide what to do, you’ll need to work out what your risks are and which ones are most urgent:</p>
<ol class="body-copy-list-order">
<li><strong>Identify<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– work out what risks your business could face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Analyse<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>– find the level of the risks and which ones are most urgent.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>– compare the risk against set risk criteria to decide what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="body-copy-content" lang="en">
<p>By managing risk, you can reduce the impact of unexpected events on your business.</p>
<p>Managing risk can also help you to:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>improve your relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and the community, by understanding and managing their expectations</li>
<li>improve staff confidence in a safe work environment, through<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/health-and-safety/work-health-and-safety">workplace health and safety (WHS)</a>&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/insurance/business-insurance#workers-compensation-insurance">workers’ compensation insurance</a><a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/insurance/business-insurance"></a></li>

<p>It's a good idea to understand the different types of risks your business may face so you can recognise and plan ahead for them.</p>
<p>Risks can be:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>opportunity-based&nbsp;risk from choosing one option over other options (such as buying a new property)</li>
<li>uncertainty-based&nbsp;risk from uncertain or unknown events (such as natural disasters or loss of suppliers)</li>

<h3 class="dp-panel-heading">Uncertainty-based risks</h3>
<div class="dp-panel-content">
<p>This type of risk is from uncertainty around unknown or unexpected events. It’s hard to predict these events and the damage they can cause. It’s also hard to control the damage once they occur.</p>
<p>Examples of uncertainty-based risks include:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>damage by fire, flood or other natural disasters</li>
<li>unexpected financial loss due to an economic downturn, or bankruptcy of other businesses that owe you money</li>
<li>loss of important suppliers or customers</li>
<li>decrease in market share because new competitors or products enter the market</li>
<li>court action.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reduce the impact of uncertain events on your business, you can do things like:</p>
<ul class="body-copy-list-dot">
<li>develop an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://business.gov.au/risk-management/emergency-management/develop-an-emergency-management-plan">emergency management plan</a>&nbsp;to reduce the damage to your business in an emergency</li>

<h3 class="dp-panel-heading">Step 1: Recognise the risk</h3>
<div class="dp-panel-content">
<h1 class="entry-title" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="NaN">Step #1 Recognise the Risk</h1>
<p>Legacy workplace compliance regimes have tended to deal with risk mitigation from a ‘<strong>risk versus cost’</strong>&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<p>This has resulted in much time and money being directed at work health and safety from a physical risk perspective. This common sense approach has resulted in safety being regarded as one of the most important considerations in business.</p>
<p>Some would even go as far as saying that safety is the only ‘<strong>not-negotiable’</strong>&nbsp;in business. No doubt, if you asked yourself how many fatalities would be acceptable in your workplace, you’d most likely respond with zero!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is bullying, harassment and discrimination the NEW work health and safety?</h2>
<p>The Australian business environment has changed dramatically in recent years, whereby one might suggest that things such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">bullying</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">sexual harassment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">discrimination</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are equally as important as the physical safety of our employees.</p>
<p>The rise of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/social-media">social media</a><span>&nbsp;</span>has made it even more complex as we are now subject to online discrimination, sexual harassment and cyberbullying on a daily basis. But unfortunately, most Australian workplaces have<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>not put in appropriate mechanisms</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to help them combat these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Did you know that 70% of Australian businesses do not have a reliable workplace compliance system in place to address bullying, harassment and discrimination?</h2>
<p>Industry surveys report that more than 70% of Australian businesses do not have a reliable<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/workplace-compliance-system">workplace compliance system</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in place to support them with the increasingly complex issues around bullying, harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p>As a result, engagement surveys, exit interviews and lost time injury reports all point to a massive shift in absenteeism, staff turnover, lost productivity, mental health issues and reputational damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Give Risk vs Cost the tick!</h2>
<p>Claims of legal liability related to bullying, harassment and discrimination are on the rise and unfortunately it is no longer a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’ a business will be dealing with such a situation. Yes, the cost can be in the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>hundreds of thousands of dollars</strong>, before even considering the impact of reduced staff engagement and the unrepairable damage to a business’s reputation.</p>
<p>Most businesses have caught on and have identified this using the ‘risk versus cost’ approach to risk mitigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Future leaders go beyond ‘Risk vs Cost’ and towards ‘Risk vs Reward’</h2>
<p>Future leaders are moving beyond simple ‘risk vs cost’ analysis and are now focusing on ‘rewards’. The reward of having a workplace culture where people feel safe and treat each other fairly and with respect is undeniable.</p>
<p>This is why future leaders are starting to view<span>&nbsp;</span>workplace compliance<span>&nbsp;</span>as an ‘<strong>investment’ rather than a ‘cost’</strong>. This shift in mindset is a big first step towards all businesses becoming better places to work, customer centric and equipped for sustainable growth!</p>

<div class="dp-panel-content">
<h1 class="entry-title" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="NaN">Step #2 – Understand That The Law Does Not Discriminate Based On Size, Type Or Location Of Your Business</h1>
<div class="post-content">
<p>In the Australian business environment there are still far too many businesses that either do not understand their legal obligations or choose not to meet them, when it comes to the provision of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/">compliance training</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and having suitable workplace policies and procedures in place for things such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">bullying</a>, harassment and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a feel for some of the most common myths when it comes to why businesses choose not to invest in a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/workplace-compliance-system">robust workplace compliance system</a>, please read on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Myth #1 – We are just a small business and haven’t had a problem with this sort of stuff before.</h2>
<p>Firstly, the law does not discriminate based on size. Regardless of whether you are 5 or 5,000 employees, your business has the responsibility to meet its legal obligations when it comes to the provision of compliance training and having suitable workplace policies and procedures in place.</p>
<p>With recent surveys from the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/">Australian Human Rights Commission</a><span>&nbsp;</span>reporting that 30% of people have experienced some form of bullying behaviour in Australian workplaces, it doesn’t take too much math to work out that exposure starts in an organisation from as small as 5 employees and increases exponentially as size and operating locations increases!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Myth #2 We’ve got an employee handbook and a few policies that people sign off on when they start with us, so I think we are ok for now thanks.</h2>
<p>Given the exposure that such practises presents, we’ll pick this up as a separate blog post as part of this series. At this stage, let’s just take the time to point out that the foundation for protecting your business against successful claims of legal liability when it comes to fair work, is that you have both the training and policies in place and that you are rolling these out at induction and on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>In saying that, it’s more than just protecting your business, it’s about doing the right thing. A big part of doing the right thing is educating your employees on what is fair and equitable behaviour and what it takes to be part of a safe workplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Myth #3 The cost of rolling out bullying, harassment and discrimination training and policies in our large business is cost prohibitive, and comes second to other compliance related topics, so we will just deal with incidents if and when they occur.</h2>
<p>Yes, a few hundred thousand dollars to settle a bullying claim or a single incident of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">sexual harassment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is far less of a cost than diligently training and re-training thousands of employees on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>However, I’d like to suggest this is not a good measure of ‘risk versus cost’ because the real cost comes down to things such as ‘reputational damage’ or even worse, the ongoing lack of engagement across your workforce if these things are happening and polluting the workplace.</p>
<p>We don’t need to look too much further than some of the recent reports coming out of the health sector in Australia when it comes to bullying and sexual harassment, which has for a long time played second to health related compliance topics for audit purposes.</p>

<div class="dp-panel-content">
<h1 class="entry-title" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="NaN">Step #3 Have The Right Training And Policies In Place To Safeguard Against Successful Claims Of Legal Liability</h1>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Regardless of your leadership credentials, employee engagement scores or long standing reputation of your business, breaches in safety, invasion of privacy and workplace incidents such as bullying, harassment and discrimination can happen.</p>
<p>In fact, in today’s business environment, it is no longer a case of if but when. However, an incident such as bullying, harassment or discrimination can happen, successful claims of legal liability do not have to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is legal liability?</h2>
<p>Legal liability, sometimes referred to as ‘vicarious liability’&nbsp;means that you are held liable for a certain situation, occurrence or incident in the workplace.</p>
<p>When it comes to workplace incidents such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">bullying</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">harassment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">discrimination</a>, the question raised around whether you are liable or not is based on whether you have taken ‘all reasonable steps’ to avoid such an incident. In the eyes of the law, when it comes to workplace relations and safety, the starting point is whether your organisation has delivered suitable ‘training’ and whether you have appropriate ‘policies and procedures’ in place.</p>
<p>Far too often, the status quo of getting employees to sign off on an employee handbook, with either no training or very little training around things such as bullying, harassment and discrimination puts an organisation on the back foot in the eyes of the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In the event of a claim for legal liability, what happens if your organisation has not delivered suitable training and/or do not have policies and procedures in place?</h2>
<p>For anyone who has been involved in a workplace relations and safety matter that has gone to mediation or to court, you will recall that one of the very first questions that is raised, is. What training does your organisation have in place? Followed by When was the last time you trained your staff?</p>
<p>If the answer is no or the last time training was done was back when the employee started with your business 4 or 5 years ago, then it is highly likely that your business and your directors will be exposed and can be held liable for the actions of the employee(s) responsible for the particular incident(s).</p>
<p>In some cases the perpetrator could be a single rogue employee who in hindsight should probably not have been hired in the first place!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Don’t fall in the trap of being misled by the #1 myth when it comes to workplace relations and safety incidents?</h2>
<p><strong>We’re just fine thanks, because we have policies in place and people sign these off when they start with us.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, this is a myth because the only protection against successful claims of legal liability is that you have both training and workplace policies in place.</p>
<p>Secondly, having people sign off upon starting in your organisation is not nearly enough. You must be able to demonstrate that you have a robust workplace compliance regime in place that includes ongoing training and policy sign off for the life of your employees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What’s the simplest way to address our workplace training and policy requirements?</h2>
<p>70% of Australian businesses do not currently have appropriate<span>&nbsp;</span>compliance management systems<span>&nbsp;</span>in place that enable them to meet both their training and workplace policy requirements when it comes to fair work, privacy and health and safety matters.</p>
<p>There’s a number of factors for these scary metrics, with the primary one being that many organisations have in the past not paid respect to the massive impacts of such incidents in the workplace, to the individual, other employees, clients and the overall reputation of the organisation.</p>
<p>So if your organisation is in the 70% of Australian businesses that do not have appropriate measures in place, you may want to start by looking at an<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/workplace-compliance-system">online workplace compliance system</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that enables you to deliver<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/services">workplace compliance training</a>, manage your policies and get real-time reports on completions for audit purposes.</p>
<p>It’s the most practical way to safeguard your business against the escalating costs of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/7-steps-good-businesses-take-mitigate-risk-non-compliance">non-compliance</a>. It’s also a very pragmatic way to send a clear message to your staff that everyone is responsible for contributing to a workplace that is a better, safer and fairer place to come to work!</p>

<div class="post-content">
<h2>It is 9.30 am on a Monday morning.</h2>
<p>Your Human Resource Manager comes into your office, with a concerned look on her face. There’s been a report of misconduct at your Christmas Party from last Friday night. The misconduct was of a sexual nature and word has spread.</p>
<p>As a CEO, it’s definitely not the sort of thing you want to start your work week with. Your head starts spinning.</p>
<p>What happened? Who was involved? How is the victim? What about other’s who may have missed it? Oh no, what happens if the media get’s their hands on this? Or have they already got their hands on it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fast forward the clock several hours.</h2>
<p>You have investigated the claim and found that it is correct, one of your employees has sexually harassed another employee. Everyone in your organisation knows about what happened. Several clients have also found out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Now fast forward the clock 24 hours.</h2>
<p>It’s on the front page of the paper! Yes, it all happens that quickly. So too does the mediation, legal proceedings and potential court case that follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>No responsible CEO would want a breach in safety, invasion of privacy or workplace incident such as bullying, harassment or discrimination to happen in their workplace!</h2>
<p>But unfortunately,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/mistake-5-most-businesses-do-not-have-processes-for-reporting-workplace-incidents">workplace incidents</a><span>&nbsp;</span>can and will happen. Even though you want your people to do the right thing and contribute to a workplace where people are safe and treated fairly and with respect, in today’s business environment, we can no longer be certain about common decency.</p>
<p>And when an incident plays out, if you have not been meeting your legal obligations of delivering education and having workplace policies in place for things such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">bullying</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">harassment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">discrimination</a>, you will be left exposed.</p>
<p>You will also be left asking, why did I not have these things in place, to start with!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The best risk mitigation when it comes to workplace incidents such as bullying, harassment and discrimination is to begin with the end in mind the Your Honour Test</h2>
<p>If there was an incident in your workplace and it ended up in court, can you hand on heart say that you have taken all reasonable steps to ensure that you have educated your people on<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/workplace-compliance-courses">workplace relations and safety matters</a>?</p>
<p>Can you also hand on heart say that you have<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/right-training-policies-place-safeguard-successful-claims-legal-liability">policies and procedures</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in place to guide people in the event of an incident?</p>
<p>The best organisations have considered the Your Honour Test and put a reliable<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/workplace-compliance-system">workplace compliance system</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in place to help them do the right thing and protect their business against the ever increasing costs of breaches in safety, invasion of privacy and workplace incidents such as bullying, harassment and discrimination.</p>
<p>It’s quite straight forward in hindsight. Did I train my staff? Did I have policies in place? Did my managers/supervisors follow the procedures outlined in the policies, in the case of the incident?</p>
<p>These are the types of questions that you will be asked in a worse cases scenario. And of course, if you have them in place to start with, chances are you may not be dealing reactively to an incident in the first place.</p>

<p>The best organisations recognise that education around things such as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/work-health-and-safety">work health and safety (WHS)</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/privacy">privacy</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">workplace bullying</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">sexual harassment</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">equal employment opportunity (EEO)</a>, and the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/social-media">appropriate use of internet and social media</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are all necessary so that everyone is able to identify what appropriate behaviour and inappropriate behaviour in the workplace is.</p>
<p>Education is not just a one off when somebody starts in the organisation, a water cooler conversation or references made on page 27 of an employee handbook. But rather an ongoing and deliberate commitment from the leadership team, managers and supervisors, across the organisation to deliver formal training and refresher training, accompanied by ongoing mentoring and guidance as to what behaviour is required from everyone to ensure a safe workplace where people are treated fairly and with respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>One of the biggest mistakes an organisation can make is to think that an employee handbook or a workplace policy on an important matter such as workplace bullying is adequate.</h2>
<p>Employee handbooks and policies are a start, but they are not enough. Not enough in the eyes of the law and certainly not enough when it comes to best practise education for employees within your organisation.</p>
<p>That is why the best organisations address the education piece. They want their people to understand what appropriate behaviour looks like. They similarly want their people to identify if inappropriate behaviour is taking place and how to report this. Only once something is reported can it be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The best organisations recognise that when people are safe, they can do their best work, and when they do their best work, by default the customer is happy, resulting in greater shareholder returns.</h2>
<p>Yes, a policy and procedure can provide us with definitions, provide us with a guide to reporting incidents as well as the resolution process.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, far too many organisations have not taken time to educate their staff in the first place, as to what appropriate behaviour should look like. So next time you are thinking about<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/services">workplace compliance training</a><span>&nbsp;</span>as just another cost to your business, please stop and think.</p>
<p>What would a great leader do?</p>
<p>What would a highly engaged business do?</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right, they would see education in regard to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/right-training-policies-place-safeguard-successful-claims-legal-liability">workplace relations and safety</a><span>&nbsp;</span>matters to be an investment not a cost. Just like any other form of professional development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The best organisations see education on human rights to be an investment and not a cost of doing business to adhere to compliance or meet their legal obligations</h2>
<p>And of course the education is not just limited to individuals knowing how to identify and report incidents of bullying, harassment or discrimination. But rather, that managers/supervisors know how to deal with such reports and can support all parties to come to an appropriate resolution.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s part education and policies and part leaders treating an incident, if there is one, in a way that aligns with a culture that promotes a safe, fair and appropriate workplace.</p>

<div class="dp-panel-content">
<h1 class="entry-title" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="NaN">Step #6 Have A Management Team That Foster A Good Workplace Culture</h1>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Regardless of how we train people, or what<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/mistake-5-most-businesses-do-not-have-processes-for-reporting-workplace-incidents">policies and procedures</a><span>&nbsp;</span>we have in place, like most things in life, it’s a case of show me don’t tell me. What we see and hear is often what we follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Management, just like good parenting, requires a positive role model.</h2>
<p>Based on a survey conducted by the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.humanrights.gov.au/">Australian Human Rights Commission</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in 2012, 1 in 2 workers have witnessed<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/workplace-bullying">workplace bullying</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in the Australian workplace. In far too many cases, the bullying behaviour has come right from the top.</p>
<p>Really, It doesn’t take a lifetime in HR or PhD in Psychology to recognise that this is not good form. Just like great parenting, thankfully the best organisations have leaders who respect human rights and go out of their way to make people feel safe.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is a better example, rather than reflecting on those organisations that do not do it well. Yes, the most highly engaged organisations have a careful and deliberate approach to human rights and appropriate workplace behaviours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why do some managers get it and some just don’t.</h2>
<p>Well, it’s probably the same as asking why some kids are bullies in the school yard and why do some kids stand by and watch it happen.</p>
<p>On that note, that is where good managers and supervisors are so important when it comes to the right behaviour in the workplace. They set the example of good behaviour. They genuinely<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/about-us">do the right thing</a>, not just because it is the law, but because they want people to feel safe and to be treated fairly and with respect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they identify bad behaviour and deal with it, and reward good behaviour. Just like good parents, or good school teachers, or sporting coaches, they foster a workplace where human rights is the starting point for success. And that makes all the difference!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Regardless of what role or seniority you have in a workplace, we all play a role.</h2>
<p>Far too often people can sit back and watch poor behaviour play out, with the plausible excuse that it’s somebody else’s problem.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately that is not good enough. We need to stand up and stop lying to ourselves with plausible excuses, and start to take manageable action to make our workplace better, safer and fairer.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s critical that an executive group and their managers/supervisors set the tone, but we all have a part to play when it comes to freeing our workplaces of incidents of bullying,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/sexual-harassment">sexual harassment</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/compliance-courses/equal-employment-opportunity">discrimination</a>.</p>

<div class="dp-panel-content">
<h1 class="entry-title" data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="NaN">Step #7 Send A Clear Message From Top Down</h1>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Let’s not even get into corporate jargon around leadership, culture and engagement. Instead, let’s reflect on some old school wisdom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A wise person once said that the best thing a father can do for their children is to love their mother.</h2>
<p>Why is this so important in the make-up of a family unit? Yes, it is clearly a good place to start for a healthy relationship between mum and dad.</p>
<p>But how about the message it sends to the kids’. How does this example of kindness and compassion from a father to a mother (or vice versa) extend to the way our children treat others… And as importantly, how they expect to be treated by others.</p>
<p>Yes, who you are surrounded by is who you become, so in a family situation, how fortunate children are when their parents treat each other with love and kindness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Another wise person also said that no matter what happens in life, our children should always feel safe.</h2>
<p>Well, that is kind of obvious is it not? Of course we want our children to feel safe. Those of us with a teenage child who comes home late at night, know the stressful feeling of wondering if everything is OK.</p>
<p>But what about the simple acts of kindness like making our children feel safe asking us tricky questions, or feeling comfortable to admit their fault. It’s a different form of safety then simply physical safety. But is this not still safety?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So where is all this going and what has this to do with my business or my working life?</h2>
<p>In a word.. Everything. It has everything to do with the very essence of ‘send a message from the top down’.</p>
<p>In the same way that father treats mother well, so too should a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>CEO treat their people well.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>In the same way that we make our children feel safe, so too should a CEO make their people feel safe. It starts from the top and that sets the tone for the rest of the organisation.</p>
<p>Now, we are not suggesting that just because a CEO does the right thing that they are immune to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/mistake-5-most-businesses-do-not-have-processes-for-reporting-workplace-incidents">workplace incidents</a>. But what we are suggesting is that it is a very good starting point.</p>
<p>And of course, when there is a top down approach to things such as safety, privacy, professional conduct and human rights, then an organisation is also investing in the necessary education and also have policies in place to ensure that not only are they meeting their legal requirements for<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/safeguard-by-sentrient-sme">workplace compliance</a><span>&nbsp;</span>but they are going well beyond this.</p>
<p>When an organisation truly invests in making their workplace better, safer and fairer, productivity sky rockets and the hidden costs of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sentrient.com.au/blog/7-steps-good-businesses-take-mitigate-risk-non-compliance">non-compliance</a><span>&nbsp;</span>diminish.</p>
<p>Moving beyond parenting examples, as the final blog in this series, perhaps a nice parting thought is in the words of Sir Richard Branson.</p>
