<h3><span style="color: #34495e;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What is Copyright Law?</span></strong></span></h3>
<p>Copyright law creates incentives for people to invest their time, talent and other resources in creating new material – particularly cultural and educational material, which benefits society. In Australia, copyright law is set out in the <i>Copyright Act 1968 </i> (Cth). This is federal legislation, and applies throughout Australia.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #34495e;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Copyright &amp; Intellectual Property Obligations when downloading from the internet</span></strong></span></h3>
<p class="p1">Generally, there is copyright protection on any creative piece which includes printed forms, music, graphics and illustrations, photos and videos.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a common belief by many that the internet is ‘public domain’ and that anything accessed and downloaded from the internet does not have IP rights or copyright protection.</p>
<p class="p1">This is not true.</p>
<p class="p1">There is a document that has been published by the Australian Copyright Council called:</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;">“Internet: Copying and Downloading”</p>
<p class="p1">It goes into significant detail on the subject of downloading materials from the internet and what can and cannot be used without infringing on IP rights and copyright.</p>
<p class="p1">This document is available on the Australian Copyright Council website at:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is Intellectual Property (IP)?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In simple terms, Intellectual Property refers to the ownership of an idea or design by the person (or organisation) that came up with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Intellectual Property can be broken into 4 main types:</span></p>

<p>Trade secrets are a type of intellectual property that includes formulas, practices, processes, designs, instruments, patterns, or compilations of information that have inherent economic value because they are not generally known or readily ascertainable by others, and which the owner takes reasonable measures to keep secret. Intellectual property law gives the owner of a trade secret the right to restrict others from disclosing it. In some jurisdictions, such secrets are referred to as confidential information.</p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Introduction to Copyright in Australia</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), or more simply The Copyright Act, regulates copyright in Australia in relation to original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, and subject matter other than works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In 1968, the Australian Copyright Council (ACC), a not-for-profit organisation, was also developed to help promote the understanding of Copyright law and its applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A fact sheet about Copyright Law in Australia can be found here:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled" title="Intro to Copyright in Australia.pdf" href="$IMS-CC-FILEBASE$/Uploaded%20Media/Intro%20to%20Copyright%20in%20Australia.pdf?canvas_=1&amp;canvas_qs_wrap=1" target="_blank" data-canvas-previewable="false" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.parra.catholic.edu.au/api/v1/courses/28148/files/3941919" data-api-returntype="File">Intro to Copyright in Australia.pdf</a>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The responsibility for copyright in Australia belongs to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Important thing to note:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This legislation covers Copyright within the Australian borders. When Copyrighted work is used outside of Australia, that work is subject to the Copyright laws of that country. In order to protect the owners of the copyrighted work on an international scale, international treaties were developed to help establish a minimum legal requirement in each country. These include but are not limited to the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention.</span></em></p>

<h3 class="dp-panel-heading">Ethics</h3>
<div class="dp-panel-content">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is Ethics?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Ethics is the code of moral principles and values that governs the behaviours of a person or group with respect to what is right or wrong. Ethics set standards as to what is good or bad in conduct and decision making. An ethical issue is present in a situation when the actions of a person or organisation may harm or benefit others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ethical Theories and Approaches</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When faced with an Ethical Dilemma in the workplace, there are a few different approaches that can be taken. Read about these in the following presentation:</span></p>

<h3 class="dp-panel-heading">Privacy</h3>
<div class="dp-panel-content">
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is Privacy?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>Privacy is a fundamental human right that underpins freedom of association, thought and expression, as well as freedom from discrimination.</span></span></p>
<p>Generally speaking, privacy includes the right:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be free from interference and intrusion</li>
<li>to associate freely with whom you want</li>
<li>to be able to control who can see or use information about you</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are different ways to look at privacy, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical privacy (for instance, being frisked at airport security or giving a bodily sample for medical reasons)</li>
<li>surveillance (where your identity can’t be proved or information isn’t recorded)</li>
<li>information privacy (how your<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information">personal information</a><span>&nbsp;</span>is handled)</li>
</ul>
<p>Information privacy is about promoting the protection of information that says who we are, what we do and what we believe.</p>
<p>The Privacy Act 1988 <span>covers how your personal information is handled by Australian Government agencies and any organisation with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/rights-and-responsibilities#WhoHasResponsibilitiesUnderPrivacyAct">some other organisations</a><span>.&nbsp;The Privacy Act doesn’t specifically cover surveillance but there are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/surveillance-and-monitoring">situations</a><span>&nbsp;where it may apply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Australian Government department in charge of regulating the Privacy Act is the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Further information about Privacy in Australia can be found at their website below:</span></p>
<p><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy" target="_blank"><span>https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Important thing to note:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><span>Your right to privacy isn’t absolute. Sometimes other concerns are given priority, such as the safety of you or others, or the interests of justice. But it’s important. That’s why strict rules apply in these situations.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Privacy in Organisations</span></strong></p>
<p>The Australian Privacy Principles (or APPs) are the cornerstone of the privacy protection framework in the<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2004A03712" target="_blank">Privacy Act 1988</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(Privacy Act). They apply to any organisation or agency the Privacy Act<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/rights-and-responsibilities#WhoHasResponsibilitiesUnderPrivacyAct">covers</a>.</p>
<p>There are 13<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-quick-reference">Australian Privacy Principles</a>&nbsp;and they govern standards, rights and obligations around:</p>
<ul>
<li>the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/collection-of-personal-information">collection</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/use-and-disclosure-of-personal-information">use and disclosure</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/what-is-personal-information">personal information</a></li>
<li>an organisation or agency’s governance and accountability</li>
<li>integrity and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/correct-your-personal-information">correction</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of personal information</li>
<li>the rights of individuals to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/your-privacy-rights/your-personal-information/access-your-personal-information">access</a><span>&nbsp;</span>their personal information</li>
</ul>
<p>The Australian Privacy Principles&nbsp;are principles-based law. This gives an organisation or agency flexibility to tailor their personal information handling practices to their business models and the diverse needs of individuals. They are also technology neutral, which allows them to adapt to changing technologies.</p>
<p>A breach of an Australian Privacy Principle&nbsp;is an ‘interference with the privacy of an individual’ and can lead to regulatory action and penalties.</p>
